# To do...

## Threading
Maybe, idk we will see how it handles scaling

## Role checking
Currently bot is checking for whether @everyone has embedlink perms so if it is given them seperate from the @everyone role it will still default to text message only

## Better install script
Need to do testing on different OS's
