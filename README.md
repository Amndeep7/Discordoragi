# Discordoragi
Discordoragi is a Discord bot based on [Roboragi](http://github.com/Nihilate/Roboragi) which creates anime and manga links from MAL, Hummingbird, Anilist, MangaUpdates and Anime-Planet when requested.

## Technical info
Discordoragi is written in Python for use with Python 3. There's a requirements.txt if you want to test it out yourself, but you'll need to create a Config.py with your own information and set up a PostgreSQL database.

## How it works

## Current databases
- MAL (Anime + Manga)
